# BetterTimingLinePlacer
Places timing lines that don't interfere with timing, and also don't have to be separated by more than 1 millisecond.

Don't delete the first timing line made by this plugin, otherwise no timing lines will show up in the map at all.
For some reason has a largely unnecessary per map persistent memory (?) implementation.

There's like no use case for this plugin.
